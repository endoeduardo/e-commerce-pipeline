# e-commerce-pipeline

An ETL pipeline designed as a study case for extracting, transforming, and loading e-commerce data.

This project leverages **Scrapy** for web scraping e-commerce data, **Apache Airflow** for orchestrating ETL workflows, and **PostgreSQL** for storing and managing the scraped data. The pipeline demonstrates the full data lifecycle from extraction to loading, with the potential for data analysis and reporting.
